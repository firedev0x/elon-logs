# elon-logs
This project connects to xAI's Grok model via API and asks it the same question on every run: "say one surprising and literally true thing about Elon Musk." Each answer is auto-posted to a dedicated X (Twitter) account. No human intervention. No editing. No filters.

i built a script that calls grok through the api and asks it just one question: “say one surprising and literally true thing about Elon Musk.” the same script then auto-posts grok’s response on an x account, slowly building a database of its answers. no human writes the posts.

the code is here on github + node server all grok’s answers will be posted here: https://x.com/elonlogsbot

everything is automated and will run forever.

to support the project, i’ll also launch a token on pumpfun. creators revenue will be enough to keep things alive.
